###**Toyota corolla**

```
Toyota Corolla was first launched in 1966
 
```

```
EEPROM
Memory Size	2Kbit
Memory Organization	256 x 8, 128 x 16
AT93C56
2 MHz clock frequency 
Low-voltage and standard-voltage operation 
```


**Notes:**

```
Toyota introduced the Corolla Altis in India in 2003 and offered three generations until its discontinuation in 2020 due to BS6 emission norms and declining sales. The eleventh-generation Corolla Altis, launched in April 2014, came with a 1.8-litre petrol engine producing 138.1bhp and a 1.4-litre diesel engine producing 87.2bhp. In March 2017, a facelifted version was introduced with updated features. The Corolla Altis was discontinued in March 2020


I think it sold approximately 116,000 units until its discontinuation in March 2020.

**AIM:**

Find the Toyota Corolla memory address of three keys.

Write the decoding program and extract the three key values from the .bin file.



**run**


```
bash Toyota_Corolla_Decode.sh 

```

### In many Volkswagen systems:

* The **BCM (Body Control Module)**, **ECM (Engine Control Module)**, **IMMOBILIZER**, and **METER (dashboard)** all communicate via **CAN BUS**.
* For **key programming**, all units must be synchronized and in **service mode** or **learn mode**.

---

### Meaning of `0x08F0` Byte (`0000` vs `FFFF`):

* **`0000` = Normal Mode**
  → Immobilizer active
  → Modules are locked
  → Key programming **not allowed**

* **`FFFF` = Service/Learn Mode**
  → Immobilizer temporarily disabled or bypassed
  → BCM, ECM, meter ready to accept new key
  → Key programming **allowed**

---

### Why does this matter?

When `FFFF` is set:

* Tools like OBD programmers can talk to all modules
* No "security access" blocks
* Synchronization allowed between BCM ↔ ECM ↔ IMM ↔ Meter

---

✅ So yes — `FFFF` at that location likely means:

* Vehicle is in **service mode**
* Communication is **unlocked**
* Key programming is **enabled**
