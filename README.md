**Notes:**

```
Toyota introduced the Corolla Altis in India in 2003 and offered three generations until its discontinuation in 2020 due to BS6 emission norms and declining sales. The eleventh-generation Corolla Altis, launched in April 2014, came with a 1.8-litre petrol engine producing 138.1bhp and a 1.4-litre diesel engine producing 87.2bhp. In March 2017, a facelifted version was introduced with updated features. The Corolla Altis was discontinued in March 2020


I think it sold approximately 116,000 units until its discontinuation in March 2020.
